                    <blockquote>
                        <p>When it comes to maximizing your lean muscle gains while cutting body fat very quickly you need to follow a strict diet and training regimen.
This involves tracking your macros and the timing of when you consume your carbohydrates, protein and healthy fats.The goal of this diet is for you to maintain all of your lean muscle mass while slowly losing body fat. You will peak in about 8 weeks following this diet.
If you have around 12-14 percent body fat, expect to get to less than 10 percent body fat while keeping all of your lean muscle mass after 8 weeks of this regimen.
If you have around 10 percent body fat expect to resemble a lean and chiseled fitness model after 8 weeks of following this regimen.
This is the ultimate cutting diet and will give you tremendous results without sacrificing any of your lean muscle gains that you have trained so hard for.
Now – lets first address the main issue with most cutting diets. If you have worked really hard to build a solid base of lean muscle mass then you have to keep in mind that you can lose this muscle mass very easily if you diet down too fast and don’t understand the science behind consuming certain macronutrients relevant to your training regimen.
This is why we need a scientific approach to maximizing your fat loss while keeping and even in some cases building lean muscle mass. Your ability to build lean muscle mass while on this bodybuilding cutting diet will depend on a number of X factors.
These X factors include your training intensity, bodybuilding split, supplementation and sleep. These are the X factors that will give you incredible results and will take your cutting diet to the next level.

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>1. CONSUME A CALORIE SURPLUS<br>
The first golden rule of bodybuilding is that you must eat to grow. Your body needs to enter a calorie surplus in order to gain weight and build muscle mass.
If you are in a calorie deficit or at maintenance your body will not have the proper fuel and extra amino acids to pack on slabs of muscle.
If you are consuming less energy than your body burns you are putting it into a calorie deficit which makes it impossible to gain muscle mass because your body’s ability to create muscle proteins is impaired.
So we know that you need to consume a calorie surplus to gain lean muscle mass, but how much of a calorie surplus is ideal? If your goal is to gain lean muscle mass without any additional fat storage here is a good formula to follow.

                        <p>2. CONSUME ENOUGH PROTEIN<br>
                          Everybody knows that your body needs protein to build muscle, but how much protein do you need to build muscle?
                          Consuming enough protein ensures that your body has the crucial amino acids it needs to synthesize its own proteins and enter a state that is called “protein synthesis.”
                          Your body needs a constant supply of these muscle-building amino acids to repair and rebuild bigger and stronger and these amino acids are found in the proteins you consume.
                          The big question is how much protein is ideal to maximize lean muscle growth without additional fat storage?
                          Consuming around 1 gram of protein for every lb of bodyweight has been the bodybuilding standard for years – so lets dive into a few research studies to further evaluate the exact amount of protein needed to build muscle.

                           <p>3. MAXIMIZE YOUR ANABOLIC WINDOW<br>
                     Insulin is the most anabolic hormone in your body. Following a workout it is vital that you consume a post workout supplement that contains protein and fast carbohydrates to spike your insulin.

                    <p><small>If you follow this bodybuilding cutting diet you should expect to lose anywhere between 1-1.5 lbs of fat PER WEEK while maintaining all of your lean muscle mass. If you are losing more weight than this per week you are LOSING lean muscle mass.
It is very important that we don’t cut our calories more than 500 per day while following the bodybuilding cutting diet. This results in an approximate net loss of 3,500 calories per week – which equals 1 lb of fat.
Now depending on your training and cardio regimen you may lose slightly more than this if you are able to elevate your metabolism through advanced training strategies such as HIIT and plyometrics, which will boost your metabolism following the workout.
